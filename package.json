    "description": "Resource Groups Tagging API This guide describes the API operations for the\nresource groups tagging.\n\nA tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and\na value, both of which you define. For example, if you have two Amazon EC2\ninstances, you might assign both a tag key of \"Stack.\" But the value of \"Stack\"\nmight be \"Testing\" for one and \"Production\" for the other.\n\nTagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify\nresource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information\nabout tagging, see Working with Tag Editor\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html] and \nWorking with Resource Groups\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/resource-groups.html].\nFor more information about permissions you need to use the resource groups\ntagging APIs, see Obtaining Permissions for Resource Groups\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-resource-groups.html] \nand Obtaining Permissions for Tagging\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html]\n.\n\nYou can use the resource groups tagging APIs to complete the following tasks:\n\n *  Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified region for the\n   AWS account\n   \n   \n *  Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified\n   region for the AWS account\n   \n   \n *  List all existing tag keys in the specified region for the AWS account\n   \n   \n *  List all existing values for the specified key in the specified region for\n   the AWS account\n   \n   \n\nNot all resources can have tags. For a lists of resources that you can tag, see \nSupported Resources\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/supported-resources.html] \nin the AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User Guide.\n\nTo make full use of the resource groups tagging APIs, you might need additional\nIAM permissions, including permission to access the resources of individual\nservices as well as permission to view and apply tags to those resources. For\nmore information, see Obtaining Permissions for Tagging\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html] \nin the AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User Guide.",
